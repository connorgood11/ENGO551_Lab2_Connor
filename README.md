The database contains details about books such as their ISBN, Title, Author and Publish Year.
The Sign Up page allows users to sign up with a username and password.
The username is unique, so no two users can have the same username, which allows to sign in privately.
The theme.html file is used to create a navbar that is accesible through any webpage.
The nav bar allows you to navigate to homepage or logout.
Once the user is logged out, it redirects to the homepage.
